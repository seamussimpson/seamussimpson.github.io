<p>BJ's Rentals, Inc.

<h3>Forklift Area Frankfort IN</h3>
<p>Cumulative lift truck production in Japan reached 500,000 vehicles in 1985, and global cumulative lift truck production reached one million vehicles in August 1995. Ohio Power Tool is proud to be one of the exclusive distributors and repair facilities for Gray jacks and lifts. These drivers should not forego lifted trucks, but should consider a lower height that would accomplish their goal without exceeding what is necessary.</p>
<p>Reach forklifts exemplify these features as they can reach higher storage levels than standard models and have a better control response time. Standard 2-ton counterbalance forklifts can cost over $20,000 in good condition, and many cost much more when brought brand new. BakerCorp is a leading provider of tank, pump, filtration and trench shoring rentals, with about 950 employees, 46 locations in North America, and another 11 locations in Europe.</p>
<p>Five new forklift models - with load capacities from 1.4 - 2.5 tons - deliver class-leading performance, and lift heights up to 13 metres. Counterbalance forklift trucks are majorly preferred for use in applications where space is limited due to their effective maneuverability. A body lift increases the truck's ride height without changing the suspension, making them a good choice for light off-roading and adding a touch of style.</p>

<p>Featuring an electric drive motor, this versatile hand pallet truck provides powered movement in either direction for nearly effort-free travel. The JBT-intelligent robotic reach truck uses a combination of sensors and 3D cameras for maximum precision and effectiveness at higher-level storage locations, capable of exceeding the productivity of operator-driven trucks.</p>
