<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>When you need power out of your forklifts, turn to Tynan for all the power you can handle. Employers must certify that operators have received all necessary training and evaluate each operator at least once every three years. The AC motors that power order pickers deliver smooth controllable power for speedy operation and precise control, without the expensive cost of diesel fuel.</p>
