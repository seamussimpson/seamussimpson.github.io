<h2>Powered Pallet Truck Columbia Falls</h2>

<p>This product is made in USA, and it can handle with any materials you may have. The heavier the load - and the higher you lift - the further forward the combined center of gravity goes. Crown's VNA trucks, designed with comfort and stability, are built to perform and help maximize your warehouse space.
