<p>On certain types of trucks, the weight on the braking wheel (s) may be insufficient to attain drawbar drag values required for higher combinations of ramp and speed. But "rough terrain" isn't simply an indication of the machine's robust nature. Turret trucks or Swing-Reach® can work in aisles as narrow as 60”, and are used for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.</p>

<p>These developments constitute a dramatic departure from the norm, according to Brett Wood , chairman of the Industrial Truck Association (ITA) and president and CEO of Toyota Material Handling North America. A reach truck provides a range of features to help you to do the job. Indoor forklifts come with cushion tires to make it easier to maneuver on smooth warehouse floors.</p>
<p>This includes, but is not limited to, straddle carriers, hustlers, toploaders, container reach stackers, and other vehicles that carry, push, pull, lift, or tier loads. Place empty truck on initially level test platform in a position that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the test platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.</p>
<p>Our counterbalanced fork trucks are ideal for operations that require breakdown of pallets removed from trailers, long runs to P&D stations, or a combination of both. Larger items may be attached to a pallet or have indents for fork lifting built into the item itself. Manufacturing Areas: While rough terrain forklifts aren't designed for indoor use, you can put them to work in enclosed spaces.</p>

Many companies are focusing on development of reach trucks with features such as robust construction, smooth functioning, and enhanced durability.</p>
