<p>SCA Performance RAM trucks are some of the most powerful and performance-ready lifted trucks in the industry. This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life. However, the deaths of nearly 100 workers and 20,000 serious injuries that occur each year show that a forklift can be dangerous. Many advantages exist for using reach trucks. From reach forklifts to warehouse forklifts or rough terrain lifts - you can rely on our top-tier material handling equipment.</p>
<p>This allows it to lift small loads into tight spaces. This allows for completion of work at heights that normal forklifts cannot reach. Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>

Class I lift trucks are extremely versatile and can be used in many areas of a production operation from the loading dock to the storage facility.</p>

<p>In terms of their use, apart from being very fast, counterbalanced forklifts are ideal for working both inside and outside the warehouse. The larger ground clearance allows you to install larger tires and perhaps the best part of all is that your truck will handle the same or better than it did before depending on the type of kit you install. If you are driving aggressively in a lifted vehicle, it is a lot easier to spot the infraction and track your lifted truck down.</p>
<p>Load and unload pallets on and off trucks. I used to say, If it has forks on it and you're lifting up pallets, it's covered by the forklift standard.” But that's not 100% true anymore.

It is therefore essential to know the exact capacity and safety features of the specific forklift you are handling.</p>
