<p>However, industrial-grade masts do reportedly provide more substantial lifting capacity at height, with 6,000-lb and 8,000-lb capacity lifts serving as two popular examples among a number of rental houses.

It is therefore essential to know the exact capacity and safety features of the specific forklift you are handling.</p>
