<h3>Diesel Forklift Truck Winston Salem NC</h3>
<p>Forklift Sales Botswana started over 15 years ago, when we took on the TOYOTA Forklift Dealer, and since then we have a current, estimated 80% share of the Botswana Forklift Market. Their rental fleet is worth around $1.5 billion. From the smallest, lightest loads in retail environments to the heaviest SKUs in the highest distribution centers, our trucks can handle any order picking application and help you get the most out of every operator, every shift, every day.</p>
<p>Owning your own fleet of forklifts means you need to spend time and money maintaining them. Four fixed-fork order pickers are ideally suited for picking bulky, oversized items or where extended platforms and industrial carts are used in place of pallets. Rentals often have service and repair costs built into that monthly payment. Built for demanding use, this pallet jack is constructed from all-welded steel components.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
