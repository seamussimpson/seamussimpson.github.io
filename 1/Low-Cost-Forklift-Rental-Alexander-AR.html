<h3>Electric Forklift Repair Alexander AR</h3>
<p>Whether you need a forklift for just a day, or a fleet of them for months, we'll negotiate a deal that works best for you. We currently have over 100 Forklifts in our rental fleet as well as Skid-Steer Loaders and a Telehandler. Adding to this, growth in sectors such as retail, FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) and pharmaceutical industries will boost the Pallet Trucks demand, especially in developing parts of the globe.</p>
<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you're towing a heavy load, a lifted suspension provides the benefit of having more room to settle before the weight of the load bottoms out. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test # OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The new Toyota high capacity reach forklifts are developed for intensive stacking applications focusing on productivity, reliability, ergonomics (controls, steering and seat adapted to the driver's needs) and most importantly safety.</p>
