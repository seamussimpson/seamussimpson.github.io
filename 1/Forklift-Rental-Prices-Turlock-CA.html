Layman's Terms: Off-roading is fun, until you have to be towed 30 miles to a shop when your driveshaft falls out because you just had to have the huge lift. If you lift a load too high, you can cause the forklift to tip over. As time has passed, forklifts have tended to specialization.</p>

<p>Safety requirements relating to the elements of design, operation and maintenance of powered industrial trucks - not including vehicles intended primarily for earth moving or over the road hauling. If you know you need a forklift, but aren't sure if you'll encounter another equipment need with the same project, look no further. Industrial trucks are categorized into seven classes based on characteristics, such as engine type, design and size.</p>
<p>Counterweight - a mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame. I'm talking about the unGodly big, oversized tires, mudflaps, etc type of trucks that look completely and utterly ridiculous. Rough terrain forklifts provide a high degree of mobility and safety as well as access to areas that would otherwise be off limits. Featuring big, tractor-style tires that provide plenty of traction to handle even the most challenging outdoor terrain, these rugged trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and used outdoors.</p>

But the counterweight is larger and usually of a different design, to increase the lifting capacity.</p>
<p>Forklift Trucks have a significant and higher share across the food and beverage industry. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test OP1, or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. I notice two things right off the bat; one, the truck looks just about at home up there on that lift kit as it does on its stock ride height; and two, it hasn't seemed to have aged.</p>
