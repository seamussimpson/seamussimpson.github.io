<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>
<p>Reliable and easy-to-use, our all-terrain forklifts for hire provide great performance for your workplace. The first reason is obvious Sun Equipment does not want you to purchase the wrong used forklift for sale or spend more than you need on a used forklift with features that you will never use. For anyone who is an adventurous individual or need a truck with significant size and power, then you really have to test drive one of our lifted trucks.</p>

<p>Capable of lifting 20,000 pounds, this is the latest of Load Lifter's high-visibility forklifts. The following tests are designed to verify rated capacities of Narrow-Aisle-Rider fork trucks having rated capacities up to and including 10,000 lb at 24-inch load center and to determine capacity or alternate rated capacities. If other tests or tests for trucks over 10,000 lb rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parries.</p>
<p>A pallet jack that is too long will make it difficult to maneuver around your warehouse, and one that is too short may not fully support the load and become an unstable safety risk. Robotic technology is estimated to be used across the Class III Forklift Trucks over the forecast period. If you plan to use a rough terrain forklift in a confined space, dimensions are important.</p>
