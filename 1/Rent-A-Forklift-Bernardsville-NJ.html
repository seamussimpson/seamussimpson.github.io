<p>While excellent for indoor use, reach trucks for not suitable for outdoor work due to their under-carriage clearance. Many rough terrain forklifts can also handle work platforms. High sales of new construction lifts after 2008 are loading the used market up with competitively priced units today.

OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
