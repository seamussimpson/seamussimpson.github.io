<p>Order picking trucks have a working platform that helps the operator to control the lift. Rating Plate: This is used to inform users of the maximum load a forklift can legally carry. This perk makes rough terrain forklifts ideal for busy construction sites with limited space. With FLC's counterbalance forklift certification, you're covered in case of an accident. You can choose between a body lift kit, a suspension lift kit, and leveling lift kits.

Linear speed control, an option on many competitors' trucks, is standard on all SP models and utilises a variable height sensor to measure platform height and determine the optimum speed level.</p>
<p>Our Forklifts have developed a reputation of its own for being the most reliable in the market. Many trucks are supported by leaf spring suspensions. It also instructs on specific workplace related forklift topics, hazards and allows for operators to familiarize themselves with controls and specified equipment.
