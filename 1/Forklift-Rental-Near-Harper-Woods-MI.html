Full Free Lift = A truck where the fork carriage travels to the top of the inner mast before the inner mast begins to rise. Service intervals of 1,000 operating hours mean that trucks operate reliably. Pinch point hazards are also common when operating this type of forklift truck.</p>

Larger items may be attached to a pallet or have indents for fork lifting built into the item itself. Manufacturing Areas: While rough terrain forklifts aren't designed for indoor use, you can put them to work in enclosed spaces.</p>
<p>For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test #OP1, of at full rearward till permitted by the truck mechanism at that elevation, whichever is less stable, Where tilt restrictions for various elevations are employed, and the rearward tilt position is determined to be less stable, the truck should be tested at maximum elevation for each tilt restriction permitted by the truck mechanism.</p>

For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test # OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable.
