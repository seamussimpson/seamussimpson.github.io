Comparable to the height capacity of a standard forklift, the outrigger legs on the front of the machine can support the load up to more than 30 feet.

<p>With nine models to suit specific heavy duty applications, the H25-32XM series of all terrain forklifts provides high productivity, reliability, fuel efficiency and outstanding driver comfort to deliver an excellent return on investment. Another critical characteristic of the forklift is its instability. Choose the correct shock absorbers based on which end or ends of the vehicle you're working on. Keep in mind that some trucks use struts on the front and shock absorbers on the rear.</p>
<p>For example, if what you are used to is an automatic car, test driving should not be the time for you to attempt driving a stick shift vehicle. The Toyota Order Picker easily maneuvers narrow aisles in warehouses with minimized rack impact during case picking thanks to optional wire guidance and double rail guidance systems.

Remember: you always want to buy a forklift that has a slightly higher load capacity than what you think you will need.
