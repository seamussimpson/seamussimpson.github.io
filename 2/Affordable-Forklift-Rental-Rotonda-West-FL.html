<p>We are offering Premium quality Heavy & Medium Load capacity hydraulic Hand Pallet truck. It is the highest capacity stockpicker in the line, handling heavy palletized loads at heights up to 366 inches.

<p>Body lift kits are primarily used to lift up a truck or SUV either two or three inches higher.
