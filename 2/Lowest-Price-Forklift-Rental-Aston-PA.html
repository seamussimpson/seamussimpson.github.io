<p>Simply pick up the mobile unit with any kind of forklift or truck and drive wherever you need to go. Top-notch customer service and trustworthy equipment—that's why Atlas is one of the leading Toyota forklift dealers in the Chicago, IL area. Simple does not mean you should try to install this kind of lift kit yourself, however, unless you have a lot of experience with working on truck frames and bodies and the right equipment to do it safely.</p>
<p>And because body lift kits don't significantly modify the entire suspension, you're left with a high center of gravity and poor ways of dealing with death wobble. OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
