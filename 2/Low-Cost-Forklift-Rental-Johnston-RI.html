<p>3-wheel forklifts are typically more maneuverable than 4-wheel machines. Your crew can easily drive these machines through small openings and use them in tight workspaces. As a result, customers can get the best possible lift kit installation process. The Cat Lift Trucks Scholarship Program has awarded more than $130,000 in educational assistance to Houston-area students.</p>

Body lift kits are also typically the least expensive option when looking to lift a truck; however, a gap is created by the spacer between the body and frame.
