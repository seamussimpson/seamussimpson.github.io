<h2>Importance of Forklift Training in Union </h2>
<p>This practical training course is designed for existing fork lift truck operators who need to transfer their experience and skills towards the effective use of 4 Way Directional Reach trucks. Each Kit includes a set of "Load Leveling" Air springs specifically created to maximize load carrying capacity, ride quality, stability and overall braking control. As order pickers are mostly operated at elevated heights, it is important that operators are properly trained on maneuvering and safety of these trucks.</p>

Since washing a lifted truck also involves washing tires (and pretty massive ones sometimes), I would recommend using a handheld tire brush like the one pictured above for rubber sidewalls. There are different models of forklifts, and there are various forklift features that might not be the same with every model.</p>
