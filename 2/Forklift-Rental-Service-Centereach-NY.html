<p>BJ's Rentals, Inc. The very basics of forklift driving and safety that apply to all forklifts will not need to be covered as much in this training course, making it slightly quicker than novice training. In England a 40-cell unit has been used to drive a forklift truck and to do electric welding. When you see a sharp increase in production demand or need to supplement your core fleet, forklift rentals provide a cost-effective solution to keep production moving.</p>
<p>Completing your training and receiving your certification will only enable you to drive that specific forklift truck â€” any additional trucks will require you to take an entirely new course. We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

Comparable to the height capacity of a standard forklift, the outrigger legs on the front of the machine can support the load up to more than 30 feet.
