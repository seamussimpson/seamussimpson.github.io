A Class 7 forklift (4,000 - 10,000lb capacity) for outdoor use on rough terrain (mud, gravel, ruts). The forklift network carries high-quality equipment in all 50 states and 3 countries.</p>
<p>Owning your own fleet of forklifts means you need to spend time and money maintaining them. Four fixed-fork order pickers are ideally suited for picking bulky, oversized items or where extended platforms and industrial carts are used in place of pallets. Rentals often have service and repair costs built into that monthly payment. Built for demanding use, this pallet jack is constructed from all-welded steel components.</p>
