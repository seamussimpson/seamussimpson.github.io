<p>Toyota Forklift is proud to have the biggest range of forklifts and battery-electric warehouse equipment available in South-Africa, ensuring that whatever your requirements we have a suitable material handling solution. This amount also plays a key factor in the vehicle's stability — a forklift that carries too much weight isn't stable. Layman's Terms: This is a commonly used suspension lift component that does raise the truck, but doesn't add extra ground clearance for the underbelly.

Our stores in Sacramento, CA and throughout northern central California are fully equipped to meet your demands for rental forklifts.</p>
