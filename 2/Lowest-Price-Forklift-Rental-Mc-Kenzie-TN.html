Since counterbalance forklifts are one of the most widely-used types of powered vehicles in the workplace, they fall under typical OSHA training guidelines. Well, if it's style you're after, it's hard to beat a '17 Super Duty, even with a mild 6‚Äù lift on it. Already, when properly equipped, the truck has massive amounts of potential to look mean; painted heavy-duty bumpers with lights and winches, buff rims and aggressive tires will put you into a class of trucks a cut above.</p>

There are different models of forklifts, and there are various forklift features that might not be the same with every model.</p>
