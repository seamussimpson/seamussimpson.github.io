<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>The 12,000 lb. electric is built on a larger frame than the 8,000 to 10,000 lb. trucks.

The higher ground clearance will help your truck handle different types of road conditions.
