<p>If the operator must frequently enter and exit the forklift to access product, build pallets, etc. Ask what kind of lift it is, who installed it and if there have been any problems with it. Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>

Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are the forklifts that do most of the materials handling work in industrial facilities today. If the type of load presents a hazard, the user shall equip fork trucks with a vertical load backrest extension manufactured in accordance with Part II, 422, of this standard.</p>
