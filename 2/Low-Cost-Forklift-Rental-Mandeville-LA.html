The operator should never use the forklift as a personal lift unless wearing the proper harness and safety equipment. Counterbalance forklift trucks, the most common type, its forks protrude from the front of the machine, with no outriggers or baselegs to support the load.</p>

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
